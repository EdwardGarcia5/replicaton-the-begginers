## Datasets:

* [`rawPharmacoData.csv`](https://github.com/areyesq89/PR2017replicaton/blob/master/rawPharmacoData.csv) : raw data file generated by `downloadData.R` that contains drug response data at every dose and for each cell line and drug used in both studies. 

* [`summarizedPharmacoData.csv`](https://github.com/areyesq89/PR2017replicaton/blob/master/summarizedPharmacoData.csv) : summarized data file generated by `downloadData.R` that contains drug response data (combined over all doses) for each cell line and drug used in both studies.

## Code to generate data files (You do not need to use this):

For full reproducibility, this is the script to generate the csv files. This step has already been done for you.

* [`downloadData.R`](https://github.com/areyesq89/PR2017replicaton/blob/master/downloadData.R) : a script that uses the PharmacoGx package to format two datasets (raw and summary level) and save them as CSV files
